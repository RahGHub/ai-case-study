Amazon's future with AI looks promising, with the company investing in AI-related technologies and expecting to see billions of dollars in revenue from AI in the coming years with AI-powered jobs, AI-powered robots for warehouses and supply chain to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Also with AI-powered safety to help establish standards for the safe and responsible use of AI. Amazon has been at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence innovation for decades.(Microsoft 1)

Jeff Bezos, a Princeton graduate, founded Amazon in his Bellevue, Washington garage on July 5,1994. The company was originally called Cadabra, a play on the word “Abracadabra”, but Bezos changed the name to Amazon before launching. In April 1995 Amazon launched and went public in 1997. Bezos famously hand-delivered orders to the post office in early days.(Microsoft 1)

Jeff Bezos came up with the idea for Amazon after reading about the internet’s rapid growth and decided to take advantage of it with his online bookstore.(Microsoft 1)

Amazon also uses the data that it gleans from monitoring your sales to compete against you by offering the same items. And it owns the customer relationship, particularly if you use Amazon fulfillment services – meaning you store your goods in its warehouses and pay it to handle the shipping cost. Amazon has been accused of using a variety of unfair practices to gain and maintain its market power, including Predatory pricing, tying of products, using third- party seller data, Degrading search results. Charging high fees to sellers, and using Anti union tactics.(Microsoft 1)

Amazon heavily utilizes Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and robotics across its operations, primarily to optimize its supply chain, personalize customer experiences, and improve warehouse efficiency, with key implementations including: product recommendations engines powered by (AI), automated warehouse robots like Proteus and Cardinal, the Alexa voice assistant utilizing generative AI, and data analytics for predicting equipment failures, all running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.(Microsoft 1)

Recommendations

If I had to advise Amazon on which products and services to use I would suggest to Amazon to improve shopping experience for customers, and to specialize in a broader range of (AI) products from upcoming entrepreneurs. To keep the company relevant. 

I think offering these services would give Amazon a better advantage over there competitors.

Improving shopping experience online and specializing in a broader range of (AI) products would allow entrepreneurs allow over to sell their products on Amazon online stores and it would make Amazon a first choice option
The services I suggested would improve Amazon business 100% because Amazons competitors aren’t offering these services.
